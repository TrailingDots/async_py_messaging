        <h2>Isn't this reinventing the wheel?</h2>

        <p>There is definitely an element of that. A good message broker (e.g.
        <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>) will do much of this,
        and a purpose-built application such as <a
        href="http://www.celeryproject.org/">Celery</a> will do much more, but
        there are still good reasons to do this yourself:</p>

        <ul>

            <li><i>Exactly</i> fitted to your job. If you have a very specific
            job it can be good to know exactly what's going on, especially when
            it comes to debugging.</li>

            <li>Flexibility. ZeroMQ is a more generic, lower-level way of
            achieving a specific networking application, which means you have
            to do a bit more yourself, and it also means you CAN do more
            yourself.</li>

            <li>Fewer components. You don't need more server applications
            running and more configuration to worry about.</li>

            <li>Learning how to do it yourself is fun! Get familiar with ZeroMQ
            and you'll have a better understanding of how messaging systems are
            built.</li>

            <li>And finally: The amount of code a ZeroMQ application takes will
            surprize you.  It is not a great deal more than a similar solution
            using Celery.</li>

        </ul>
